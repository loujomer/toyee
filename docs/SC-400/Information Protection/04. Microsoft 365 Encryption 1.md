BitLocker keys management categories:
1. BitLocker-managed keys
2. BitLocker recovery keys

## Service level encryption

* root keys are used to protect key hierarchies used by service encryption regardles sof the key management option
* Service encryption includes regular key rotation to maintain key security. 
* Key rotation occurs through automated service code on internally defined schedules based on key type
* Customers who use Customer Key are responsible for rotating their root Customer Keys

#### Exchange Online
* uses BitLocker to encrypt all mailbox data at the mailbox level
#### SharePoint Online
- unique ==per-file keys== that are always exclusive to a single tenant
- During ==upload==, each file (including each updated file) is split into ==chunks== and are individually encrypted with their own unique AES 256-bit key.
- The chunks are then stored as blobs in Azure Storage, randomly distributed between different blob containers
- The chunks, keys, and the map used to reconstruct the files upon ==download== are all stored in separate locations
- Azure storage has no access to the encrypted data.

#### 2 options for service level encryption key management:

1. Microsoft Managed Keys 
2. Customer Key

### Availability key
- provide recovery capability from the unanticipated loss of customer-managed root keys
- is a root key provisioned and protected by Microsoft, which is functionally equivalent to the root keys supplied by the customer using the Customer Key feature
- is automatically generated and provisioned when customers create a data encryption policy
- By design, no one at Microsoft has access to the availability key: it's only accessible by Microsoft 365 service code.
- customers can't directly access the availability key
- Microsoft provides customers with sole authority over the disablement or destruction of the availability key
- Should the customer decide to exit the service, the availability key is purged as part of the data purge process.

## How data is encrypted in-transit

- Inter-datacenter communications between Microsoft servers - use TLS or IPsec
- Customer-facing servers - TLS
- Microsoft owns and manages its own certificate authority to manage the certificates used for TLS encryption alongside third-party solutions.
