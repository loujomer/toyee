## Enable sensitivity labels for containers and synchronize labels

1. ==Enable labels==: 
	- Follow the [Microsoft Entra documentation to enable sensitivity labels for Microsoft 365 Groups](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/identity/users/groups-assign-sensitivity-labels).
2. ==Synchronize labels==
	- In SCC PS, run the `Execute-AzureAdLabelSync` to sync labels with Microsoft Entra ID.


# Sensitivity label support and file compatibility in Office apps

## Compatibility across document formats

1. Open XML formats:
	- docx, .xlsx, .pptx

2. [[Misc. Sensitivity label#Legacy and non-standard formats|Legacy and non-standard formats:]]
	- No Persistent Labeling in Binary Formats
	- Limited Encryption and Protection
	- Content Markings (Headers, Footers, Watermarks
	- Limited Content Scanning and Auto-Labeling
	- No Unified Label Viewer Experience
	- Performance Issues
	- No Support for Co-authoring

3. PDF support
	- [[07. Apply sensitivity labels for data protection 1#Manage sensitivity labels for encryption and collaboration in Office apps#Documents automatically inherit encryption from associated emails or previous IRM policies|PDF attachments in Outlook don't inherit label-based encryption.]]
	- The potential bypass of labels when printing to PDF
	- Administrators can manage the application of sensitivity labels to PDFs through Group Policy 

## Manage sensitivity labels for encryption and collaboration in Office apps

###### Office apps are moving from IRM to sensitivity labels for encryption
###### Documents automatically inherit encryption from associated emails or previous IRM policies


## Collaborating with sensitivity labels across organizations

###### Document sharing and metadata
Sensitivity labels attach metadata to documents and emails that includes:
- organization's tenant information
- unique label identifier (GUID)
###### Cross-organizational sharing considerations
- some email clients except Outlook may not retain label metadata
- label-based encryption secures the content ==regardless of metadata visibility.==
###### Extended access controls
- External users with Microsoft Entra ID or through guest accounts can also access documents shared outside your organization.
- enabled by additional configurations for cross-tenant access and conditional access settings.

## Auditing labeling activities

[Sensitivity label activities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/audit-log-activities#sensitivity-label-activities)

- auditing information is visually represented in the content explorer and activity explorer in the data classification dashboard

## Apply sensitivity labels with Copilot for Microsoft 365 for secure collaboration


### Copilot's role with sensitivity labels

- Recognize and use sensitivity labels during user interactions, ensuring labeled data remains secure and compliant.
- Respect the encryption specified by sensitivity labels, checking user permissions before accessing labeled data.
- Apply appropriate labels to content generated by Copilot, based on the data source and user preferences.

### Use sensitivity labels with Copilot for Microsoft 365

1. Automated label inheritance
- automatically adopts the sensitivity labels of the source files it uses, ensuring consistent data security in new documents

3. Data security
- adheres to the protection settings of sensitivity labels, maintaining data security even when using AI features

4. Compliance

### Limitations and considerations

1. Label inheritance and overrides
2. Double Key Encryption (DKE)
	- Copilot can't access or use data protected by DKE, which is reserved for highly sensitive data requiring stringent protection.
3. Context recognition
	- Copilot doesn't recognize sensitivity labels in certain contexts, such as Teams meetings and chats
4. App-specific exceptions
	- Copilot can't generate content from encrypted files in apps like PPT and Word

## Protect meetings with sensitivity labels

- Sensitivity labels help encrypt meeting invites and enforce strict access controls.

#### Settings sensitivity labels can adjust 
- Who can bypass the lobby
- Who can present
- Who can record
- Encryption for meeting video and audio
- Option to automatically record
- Video watermark for screen sharing and camera streams
- Chat content copying restrictions

The sensitivity label doesn't extend to related meeting items, such as recordings, transcripts, whiteboard, and tasks.

Sensitivity labels can be applied to meeting invites in Outlook and Teams.

Sample Teams meeting with sensitivity label:

[Use sensitivity labels to protect calendar items, Teams meetings, and chat](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sensitivity-labels-meetings#limitations)

#### When does a label policy for calendar items take effect:

- new and updated calendar events in Outlook and new events in Teams
- Existing unlabeled meetings in Teams aren't automatically relabeled
- Policies can also require users to label their meetings and events.

### Configure and apply a label for channel meetings

### Apply sensitivity labels to new Teams channels from the desktop or web client

If sensitivity labels are created with a Group & site setting and the user has a ==Microsoft Entra ID P1 license==, then it's possible to control the creation of Microsoft Teams with sensitivity labeling.
