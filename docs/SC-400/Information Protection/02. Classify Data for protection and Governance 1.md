## Classify data using sensitive information types
[Interactive guide](https://mslearn.cloudguides.com/guides/Classify%20data%20using%20sensitive%20info%20types%20with%20Microsoft%20Purview%20Information%20Protection)

3 ways of identifying items:
1. Manually by users
2. Automated pattern recognition, like sensitive information types
3. Machine learning

#### Sensitive information types are used in
1. Data Loss Prevention policies
2. Sensitivity labels
3. Retention labels
4. Insider risk management
5. Communication compliance
6. Autolabeling policies
7. Microsoft Priva

#### Categories of sensitive information types
1. Built-in sensitive information types
2. Named entity sensitive information types
3. Custom sensitive information types
4. Exact data match sensitive information types

#### Fundamental parts of a sensitive information type
1. Name
2. Description
3. Pattern
	1. Primary element
	2. Supporting element
	3. Confidence Level
	4. Proximity 

#### Creating custom sensitive information types
1. Use the UI 
2. Use EDM
3. Use PowerShell

#### Provide match/not a match accuracy feedback in sensitive info types

## Classify data using trainable classifiers
[Interactive guide](https://mslearn.cloudguides.com/guides/Identify%20content%20using%20trainable%20classifiers%20in%20Microsoft%20Purview%20Information%20Protection)
### Types of classifiers
- Pre-Trained Classifiers
- Custom Trainable Classifiers

### Custom trainable classifiers

setup process:
1. Seed
2. Test
3. Publish

### One-time setup
* A one-time scan must be completed before creating any custom trainable classifiers. This scan is needed so Microsoft 365 can learn more about the content in your organization. This process takes 7 to 14 days. 

#### Seed

##### Step 1: Prepare sample data:
- consist of known positive samples
- store the sample in SPO
- at least 50, max 500 samples

##### **Step 2: Create trainable classifier**
* it takes up to 24 hours to build the prediction model
* ==In progress== classifier processes the seed data
* ==Need test items== - classifier is finished processing the seed data

#### Test
##### Step 1: Prepare test data
* create a new SPO folder for the test content and wait for the folder to be indexed
- mix of strong positives, strong negatives, and less obvious examples
- at least 200 items, max 10,000
- must be different from the initial seed data
- manually review the results

##### Step 2: Test predictive model
##### Step 3: Evaluate predictions
