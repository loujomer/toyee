#### Why are sensitive information types important?
1. Automate data discovery
2. Prevent data loss
3. Ensure compliance
4. Minimize risk
---
### Built-in sensitive information types
- preconfigured to detect common sensitive data for general compliance and data loss prevention (DLP) needs
- used with standard types of SITs

#### Advantages of built-in SITs
1. Quick deployment
2. Managed by Microsoft
3. Broad coverage

### Custom sensitive information types
- define specific patterns and rules for identifying SITs unique to the org

#### Features of custom SITs
1. Exact data match (EDM)
2. Document fingerprinting
3. Keyword dictionaries

## Create and manage custom sensitive information types
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-manage-sensitive-information-types/3-create-manage-custom

### Before you begin
1. [Regular expressions](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/libs/regex/doc/html/)
2. Proximity 
	- defines how close the primary pattern (like an ID number) must be to supporting keywords (like "employee" or "ID badge")
3. Keyword lists
	- predefined terms commonly found near sensitive data.
4. Keyword dictionaries
	- a more extensive collection of terms for complex or industry-specific detection needs
5. [SIT functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sit-functions)
	- help validate sensitive information through extra checks
6. Confidence levels
	- let you control how much supporting evidence is required to classify data as sensitive
7. [SIT limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sit-limits)

## Create and manage exact data match sensitive info types
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-manage-sensitive-information-types/4-describe-custom-with-exact-data-match?tabs=classic

- EDM-based classification enables you to create custom sensitive types that match exact values from a database
- can hold up to 100 million rows of data
- can be refreshed daily to reflect changes

### What's different in an EDM SIT
-  it matches exact data values instead of relying only on patterns or keywords

#### Schema
- an XML file that serves as the blueprint for your EDM SIT
#### Sensitive information source table
* the actual dataset used for matching
#### Rule package
rule package in an EDM SIT defines:
1. Matches 
	- specify the primary element used for exact lookups, such as a regular expression or a function.
2. Classification 
	- determines the type of sensitive information being searched for
3. Supporting elements
4. Confidence levels
5. Proximity 
6. Supporting elements

#### Primary and secondary support elements

- primary element - key data point you're looking to protect
- secondary supporting element

## Implement document fingerprinting
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-manage-sensitive-information-types/5-implement-document-fingerprint

- converts common forms, such as a standard contract or patent application, into a unique sensitive information type (SIT)

### Features of document fingerprinting

1. Works across multiple platforms 
	- can be applied to Exchange, SharePoint, OneDrive, Teams, and devices
2. Supports multiple matching types
	- partial and exact matching
3. Multilingual detection
4. Improved accuracy

### How document fingerprinting works

- identifying the unique word patterns within a document
- DLP analyzes this pattern and generates a fingerprint in the form of a small Unicode XML file containing a hash value
- This fingerprint becomes a SIT that can be associated with your DLP policies to ==detect outbound ==documents that match the original form

### Supported file types
- supports most file types allowed in [mail flow rules](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/security-and-compliance/mail-flow-rules/inspect-message-attachments#supported-file-types-for-mail-flow-rule-content-inspection?azure-portal=true)

### Limitations of document fingerprinting

doesn't detect sensitive information in:
1. Password protected files
2. Image only files
3. Files missing text from the original form
4. Files larger than 4 MB

### Matching options in document fingerprinting

1. Partial matching
	- Low confidence
	- Medium confidence
	- High confidence
2. Exact matching

To use document fingerprinting with devices, [Advanced classification scanning and protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/dlp-configure-endpoint-settings#advanced-classification-scanning-and-protection?azure-portal=true) must be turned on.

## Named entities

- use to detect person names, physical addresses, and medical terms and conditions
- complex dictionary and pattern-based classifiers

### 2 types of named entities:

- Unbundled
	- have a narrower focus, such as a single region, or a single class of terms
- Bundled
	- detect all possible matches in a class, such as All physical addresses
	- To use bundled SITs, you must activate [Advanced classification scanning and protection](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/dlp-configure-endpoint-settings#advanced-classification-scanning-and-protection) for the relevant [data loss prevention settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/dlp-configure-endpoint-settings) before they're discoverable.

## Create keyword dictionary
https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/modules/create-manage-sensitive-information-types/6-create-keyword-dictionary

* files that contain lists of sensitive terms, phrases, or keywords used to detect and flag information that requires protection
