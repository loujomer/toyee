- Meeting and chat Security
- Data intelligence
- Non-Microsoft app extension
- Container protection
- Meeting and chat Security
- Data intelligence
- Non-Microsoft app extension
- Visual marking
- Microsoft Copilot integration

### Application of sensitivity labels

- users must sign in with their Microsoft 365 work or school account

### What sensitivity labels can do

- Encryption and content marking
- Container protection
- Auto-labeling

### Elements of sensitivity labels

- Label scopes 
- Label priority
- Sublabels

### Editing or deleting a sensitivity label

* ==DELETE==
	* content that was previously labeled retains its label but might not enforce the intended protections
	* its protection settings no longer apply to new content
- ==EDIT== 
	- the version of the label that was applied to content is what's enforced on that content.

### What label policies can do

* Publish to users and groups
	* assigned to specific users or groups unlike retention lables that's assigned to locations like Exchange mailboxes
* Default label for content
* Require justification for label changes
* Mandatory labeling for certain content
* Help links for users
* Policy priority (order matters)
* Policy application time
	* might take up to 24 hours

### Sensitivity labels and Microsoft Copilot for Microsoft 365

* Copilot prioritizes the most restrictive labels
* When labels include encryption, Copilot checks user permissions before allowing access to the data.

# Encryption with sensitivity labels

- Sensitivity labels rely on the Azure Rights Management service (Azure RMS) from Azure Information Protection to encrypt documents, emails, and meeting invites. 
- Sensitivity labels also encrypt audio and video streams in Teams meetings, using a different encryption method than Azure RMS. This type is specially designed for the unique needs of Teams meetings.

### Prerequisites
- Azure Information Protection is activated.
- Your network, including firewalls, is configured properly.
- Microsoft Entra settings support encrypted content access.
- Exchange is set up for Azure Information Protection

### Configuring a label for encryption

1. Start by creating or editing a sensitivity label. Make sure to select Items as the scope for the label:
<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-compliance-information-protect-information/media/files-and-emails-scope-options-sensitivity-label.png">

2. On the **Choose protection settings for labeled items** page, select **Apply or remove encryption**. 

<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-compliance-information-protect-information/media/protection-options-sensitivity-label.png">

3. On the Encryption page, select one of these options:
	1. Remove encryption if the file or email is encrypted
	2. Configure encryption settings
		- Turns on encryption and makes the encryption settings visible.

<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-compliance-information-protect-information/media/encryption-options-sensitivity-label.png">
	
#### Configure encryption settings
1. Assign permissions now
	1. Allow access to labeled content to expire
	2. Allow offline access
2. Let users assign permissions
<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-compliance-information-protect-information/media/sensitivity-label-user-or-admin-defined-permissions.png">
	
You can grant permissions to specific people so that only they can interact with the labeled content. To do this:

1. Add users or groups who need access to the labeled content.
2. Choose their permission levels, from viewing only to full editing rights.

<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-compliance-information-protect-information/media/sensitivity-assign-permissions-settings.png">


### Updating encryption settings on labels

#### Changes to Assign permissions now

- directly affect how newly labeled or relabeled content is encrypted
- Existing content's encryption updates upon user reauthentication

#### Switching a label's configuration

* like from Do Not Forward to Encrypt-Only
	* applies only to content labeled after the change

# Client-side vs. service-side labeling

==Client-side labeling== - enables users in Office apps to interactively apply or reject recommended labels
==Service-side labeling== -  automatically applies labels to content

[Interactive guide](https://mslearn.cloudguides.com/guides/Create%20auto-labeling%20policies%20with%20Microsoft%20Purview%20Information%20Protection)
### Configure client-side auto-labeling for Office apps

- Make sure your Office apps [meet the version requirements](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sensitivity-labels-office-apps#support-for-sensitivity-label-capabilities-in-apps) for automatic labeling.
- When you set up auto-labeling, select **Items** as the scope of your label
- As you move through the configuration, you see the Auto-labeling for files and emails page

* can configure sensitive information types and trainable classifiers for auto-labeling to automatically apply labels to content 
* When using exact data match (EDM), include at least one non-EDM sensitive information type to ensure auto-labeling remains enabled.

<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-compliance-information-protect-information/media/sensitivity-labels-conditions.png">

- When this sensitivity label is automatically applied, the user sees a notification in their Office app.
- can also configure sensitivity labels for Office apps to suggest users to apply sensitivity label

<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-compliance-information-protect-information/media/sensitivity-label-automatically-applied.png">

### Configure service-side auto-labeling for SharePoint, OneDrive, and Exchange

#### Prerequisites for service-side auto-labeling

1. ==Auditing== for Microsoft 365 must be enabled.
2. Roles groups:
	- Data Classification Content Viewer
	- Content Explorer Content Viewer
	- Information Protection
	- nformation Protection Investigators
3. To auto-label files in SharePoint and OneDrive:
	- Sensitivity labels must be enabled for files
	- Files shouldn't be open or checked out during the auto-labeling process
	- SITs must be set up before the policy creation and consider testing with new documents
4. Label configuration:
	- Labels used in auto-labeling can include visual markings
	- note that these markings don't apply to documents automatically.

#### Understand simulation mode

- simulation mode is required before labels can apply automatically
- up to 1,000,000 files 
- if greater than 1M, modify the policy and simulate again

#### Creating an auto-labeling policy

1. Solutions > Information protection > Auto-labeling.
2. Create auto-labeling policy
3. On the Choose info you want this label applied to page, select a template or or select Custom policy
<img src="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl/m365-compliance-information-protect-information/media/auto-labeling-wizard.png">
4. Name your policy
5. In the Set up common or advanced rules page, define labeling rules using conditions 
6. Define new rules using conditions and exceptions. Confirm all rules are active.
7. on the Choose a label to auto-apply, select a sensitivity label to auto-apply 
8. For Exchange policies, configure optional settings on the Additional settings for email page
9. On the Decide on policy testing page, select Run policy in simulation mode

* centralized summary of how your organization classifies its data
* displays key metrics on the application of sensitivity and retention labels
* identifies top SIT across your data
* summarizes user activities on sensitive content
* offers insights into the distribution and management of classified data across Microsoft 365 services

#### Top sensitivity labels applied to content

Sensitivity labels do two things when you apply them:
1. Embeds a tag
2. Activates protective measures

#### The data classification content explorer

- provide detailed view of items tagged with sensitivity labels
- can see which labels are applied most frequently
- assess the distribution of labeled content across various locations
- directly access individual items to review their labeling and content

#### The data classification activity explorer

- show labeled content and its location
- track actions on labeled content
- reports on up to 30 days worth of data
- gathers information from the unified audit logs

##### Activity types examples:

- Label applied
- Label changed (upgraded, downgraded, or removed)
- Auto-labeling simulation
- File read
