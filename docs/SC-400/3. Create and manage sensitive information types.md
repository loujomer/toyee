#### Why are sensitive information types important?
1. Automate data discovery
2. Prevent data loss
3. Ensure compliance
4. Minimize risk

## Compare built-in versus custom sensitive information types

### Built-in sensitive information types
- preconfigured to detect common sensitive data for general compliance and data loss prevention (DLP) needs
- used with standard types of SITs

#### Advantages of built-in SITs
1. Quick deployment
2. Managed by Microsoft
3. Broad coverage

### Custom sensitive information types
- define specific patterns and rules for identifying SITs unique to the org

#### Features of custom SITs
1. Exact data match (EDM)
2. Document fingerprinting
3. Keyword dictionaries

## Create and manage custom sensitive information types

### Before you begin
1. [Regular expressions](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_68_0/libs/regex/doc/html/)
2. Proximity 
	- defines how close the primary pattern (like an ID number) must be to supporting keywords (like "employee" or "ID badge")
3. Keyword lists
	- predefined terms commonly found near sensitive data.
4. Keyword dictionaries
	- a more extensive collection of terms for complex or industry-specific detection needs
5. [SIT functions](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sit-functions)
	- help validate sensitive information through extra checks
6. Confidence levels
	- let you control how much supporting evidence is required to classify data as sensitive
7. [SIT limits](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/purview/sit-limits)
