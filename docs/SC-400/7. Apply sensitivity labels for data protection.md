## Manage sensitivity labels for encryption and collaboration in Office apps

###### Office apps are moving from IRM to sensitivity labels for encryption
###### Documents automatically inherit encryption from associated emails or previous IRM policies


## Collaborating with sensitivity labels across organizations

###### Document sharing and metadata
Sensitivity labels attach metadata to documents and emails that includes:
- organization's tenant information
- unique label identifier (GUID)
###### Cross-organizational sharing considerations
- some email clients except Outlook may not retain label metadata
- label-based encryption secures the content ==regardless of metadata visibility.==
###### Extended access controls
- External users with Microsoft Entra ID or through guest accounts can also access documents shared outside your organization.
- enabled by additional configurations for cross-tenant access and conditional access settings.
