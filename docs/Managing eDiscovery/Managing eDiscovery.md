## Adding SharePoint Sites for Teams Private and Shared Channels

* Teams private and shared channels keep their conversations and files separate from the other parts of the team to ensure that only channel members can access this content
* Each private or shared channel has a dedicated SharePoint site, which is a child of the site owned by the team

* **Private channel** - search the parent team 
* **Shared channel** - add one or more members of the channel to search the compliance records stored in the personal mailboxes
