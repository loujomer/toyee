- Microsoft Purview Message Encryption.
- Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME).
- Information Rights Management (IRM)

2 ways Microsoft uses encryption:
* service 
* customer control

| What is it? | **[DEPRECATED]**<br><br>- built on **Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS) **<br><br>- lets you send encrypted email to people inside or outside your organization, regardless of the destination email address (Gmail, Yahoo! Mail, Outlook.com, etc.). <br><br>- transport rules that define the conditions for encryption<br><br>- When a user sends a message that matches a rule, encryption is applied automatically.  <br><br>- To view encrypted messages, recipients can either get a one-time passcode, sign in with a Microsoft account, or sign in with a work or school account associated with Office 365. <br><br>- Recipients can also send encrypted replies. <br><br>- They don't need a Microsoft 365 subscription to view encrypted messages or send encrypted replies. | - applies usage restrictions to email messages<br><br>- It helps prevent sensitive information from being printed, forwarded, or copied by unauthorized people.  <br><br>- IRM capabilities in Microsoft 365 use **Azure Rights Management (Azure RMS)** | - S/MIME is a certificate-based encryption solution <br><br>- allows you to both encrypt and digitally sign a message. <br><br>- A digital signature helps the recipient validate the identity of the sender.  <br><br>- use of unique digital certificates that contain the keys for verifying digital signatures and encrypting or decrypting messages.  <br><br>- To use S/MIME, you must have public keys on file for each recipient. <br><br>- Recipients have to maintain their own private keys, which must remain secure. <br><br>- If a recipient's private keys are compromised, the recipient needs to get a new private key and redistribute public keys to all potential senders. |
| What does it do? | - Encrypts messages sent to internal or external recipients. <br> <br>- Allows you, as an admin, to customize the email viewing portal to reflect your organization's brand.  <br><br>- Microsoft securely manages and stores the keys, so you don't have to.<br>  <br>- No special client side software is needed as long as the encrypted message (sent as an HTML attachment) can be opened in a browser. | - Uses encryption and usage restrictions to provide online and offline protection for email messages and attachments.  <br><br>- Gives you, as an admin, the ability to set up transport rules or Outlook protection rules to automatically apply IRM to select messages.  <br><br>Lets users manually apply templates in Outlook or Outlook on the web (formerly known as Outlook Web App). | S/MIME addresses sender authentication with digital signatures, and message confidentiality with encryption. |
| What does it not do? | OME doesn't let you apply usage restrictions to messages. <br><br>For example, you can't use it to stop a recipient from forwarding or printing an encrypted message. | Some applications may not support IRM emails on all devices. <br><br>For more information about these and other products that support IRM email, seeÂ [Client device capabilities](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/information-protection/requirements#BKMK_ClientCapabilities). | S/MIME doesn't allow encrypted messages to be scanned for malware, spam, or policies. |
| Recommendations and example scenarios | - send sensitive business information to people outside your organization, whether they're consumers or other businesses. <br> | - when you want to apply usage restrictions as well as encryption.<br><br> | - when either your organization or the recipient's organization requires true peer-to-peer encryption.  <br><br>S/MIME is most commonly used in the following scenarios:  <br>Government agencies communicating with other government agencies  <br><br>A business communicating with a government agency |

# Don't apply multiple email encryption technologies to the same email message.
