## Creating a Mailbox with PowerShell

**remote mailbox**
* is a *cloud mailbox* associated with a mail user object that’s 
stored in an *on-premises* Active Directory
* You’ll create remote mailboxes when you want your users 
anchored in on-premises AD but their mailboxes in Exchange Online

### Creating a Cloud Mailbox for an On-Premises User (remote mailbox)


1. Make sure that your PowerShell session loads the necessary modules. You need to load both the **ExchangeOnlineManagement** and **Microsoft Graph PowerShell SDK** modules to create mailboxes and manipulate the underlying Azure AD objects.
2. Run the **New-RemoteMailbox** cmdlet to create a new user account and its Exchange Online mailbox.
3. Run the **Set-User cmdlet** to update the on-premises directory with the organizational and personal settings for the user object.
4. Run the Update-MgUser cmdlet to set the correct country code (location) for the new mailbox in the cloud. You assign a country to a user account to ensure that Microsoft 365 makes the services designated for that country available to the user. 
	For example:
	`[PS] C:\> Update-MgUser -UserId Kim.Akers@Office365itpros.com -PreferredDataLocation DE`
5.  Assign a license to the user.


### Creating a Cloud-Only Mailbox 

[PS] C:\> New-Mailbox -alias paulr -MicrosoftOnlineServicesId paulr@Office365itpros.com 


## Updating Mailbox Attributes

Some of the attributes commonly populated for mailboxes are not set with the New-Mailbox or Set-Mailbox cmdlets. 

These are attributes controlled by Azure AD and are common to all Exchange recipient objects,  whether they have a mailbox, and are updated with the **Set-User** cmdlet. 

Example: 

`[PS] C:\> Set-User –Identity "Kim Akers" –City "Dublin" –CountryOrRegion "Ireland" –Department "Marketing Operations" –Title "VP Marketing (New Products)" –Manager "Paul.Robichaux" –Office "Dublin HQ" –Company "Popular Books"`


## Add User Photos to Mailboxes

Set-UserPhoto 
* updates the photo data in a mailbox

Set-UserPhoto
* update a photo for a group mailbox (be sure to specify the GroupMailbox switch) (can also be used to update Team picture)

New-MgUserPhoto and Update-MgUserPhoto
* writes photo data to an Azure AD user account that doesn't have a mailbox (like a guest account)

648 x 648 pixels
* largest resolution supported

64 x 64 and 96 x 96-pixel
* generated by EXO to use when small thumbnails are appropriate

<500 KB
* recommended size

**Set user photo:**

`Set-UserPhoto -Identity James.Smith@office365itpros.com -PictureData` 
`([System.IO.File]::ReadAllBytes("c:\Temp\James.Smith.jpg")) -Confirm:$False`

**Check if photo already exist:**

`If (Get-UserPhoto -Identity Kim.Akers@Office365Itpros.com) {Write-Host "Kim has a photo"}


**Remove user photo:**

`Remove-UserPhoto -Identity James.Smith@office365itpros.com -Confirm:$False`


**Prevent users from changing photo:**

 `Set-OWAMailboxPolicy -Identity *OWAFullAccess* -SetPhotoEnabled $False`


## Mailbox Plans

`Get-MailboxPlan | Format-Table DisplayName, IsDefault, Name`

* a template holding settings for mailbox properties
* newly created mailbox inherits the settings from the mailbox plan chosen by EXO
* EXO uses the license assigned to the account to select the mailbox plan to apply to the new mailbox
