###### Native Mailbox Moves

Moving mailboxes between an on-premises organization and Office 365 is like a mailbox move between two on-premises organizations and is also performed by the Mailbox Replication Service (MRS). 

These moves are called Exchange online moves, which means that users can send and receive email while their mailbox is being moved.
