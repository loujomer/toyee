## Microsoft Entra roles
- Global admin
- user admin
- billing admin

by default, the Global Administrator doesn't have access to Azure resources.

By default, Azure roles and Microsoft Entra roles don't span Azure and Microsoft Entra ID. However, if a Global Administrator elevates their access by choosing the **Access management for Azure resources** switch in the Azure portal, the Global Administrator will be granted the User Access Administrator role (an Azure role) on all subscriptions for a particular tenant. The User Access Administrator role enables the user to grant other users access to Azure resources. This switch can be helpful to regain access to a subscription ^hello
